# RAPIDS Notebook Archives
Sometimes wonderful RAPIDS notebooks get old and need a pasture to be put out to.

## Competition Notebooks List: 
These notebooks are **not maintained**, should not be expected to run with the latest release, but are a master class in getting the most out of your GPU accelerated workflows with the RAPIDS partner ecosystem.  

If you would like to update the notebooks so that they do run in the latest release, and have current best practices, please do, and I'll link your update below, or even merge it into [Notebooks Contrib](https://github.com/rapidsai/notebooks-contrib)!.
